<h1>Computer Graphics</h1>
<p>Computer grahics can be split into 2 categories, raster and vector. Rasters deal with pixels on the screens and are used for photographs and images, while vectors uses mathematical functions and are characterised by clean lines.</p>
<p> <br> In this module, we are tasked to do a simple raster and vector project to familiarise ourselves with the tools we are going to use later in the module.</p>

<h2>Raster</h2>
<p>Step 1: Choose one of my selfies.</p>
<img src="./images/raster/selfie.jpg" id="picture">
<p>Step 2: Remove the background of the image. <br><br>
  This step was done using GIMP, a photo editing software, using mainly the free select tool. I followed a tutorial by the youtube channel "gimp workshop" which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/C0tg2mRroSY" target="_blank" id="link">[here]</a>. After following the tutorial and removing the background, this was what I was left with. </p>

  <p>Step 3: Substitute with a seaside scene. <br><br>
    I found a nice beach picture from a list of best island beaches from CNTraveler which can be found <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-02-24/top-10-most-beautiful-island-beaches-hawaii-australia" target="_blank" id="link"> [here]</a>. A new layer was made, and the background was added there.</p>

    <img src="./images/raster/selfieseaside.png" id="contentimage">
    <p> <br> Step 4: Resize to a width of 1024 pixels. <br><br>
      Image was resized using FastStone Photo Resizer. The picture below is the final product and is now being used in my “About me” page.

<h2 id="vector">  Vector</h2>
<p>Step 1: Find a picture of an animal. <br> <br>
  Simple enough, I just chose one of my favourite animals, the crow. Specifically, the pied crow, which has a distinct white coloured chest. After searching google images for a few minutes, I came across a picture from a youtube video by "Weird Square" that looked good, which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/cGc53GzZNMA?t=69" target="_blank" id="link"> [here]</a>, and decided to use that as the base.
  </p>

<p>Step 2: Tracing the outline of the image to form a vector art. <br> <br>
  This step was done using Inkscape with mainly just the Bezier tool. I followed a tutorial by the youtube channel "Logos by Nick", which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/s-kPg4vYKfk" target="_blank" id="link">[here]</a>. Different parts of the crow were traced out on different layers, such as the beak, body, wing etc. Each layer was given a different colour to differentiate it from the other layers. Pictured below are some of the different layers and the final picture is how the final art looks.

<img src="./images/vector/crowlegs.png" id="contentimage">
<img src="./images/vector/finalcrow.png" id="contentimage">

<p> <br> Step 3: Making a logo with the art. <br><br>
  As the crow art itself already looks decent enough, I just added a circle with a thick stroke surrounding the crow. A light grey background was chosen to contrast the dark theme of my website. Once it was done, I exported it as a png and set it to a height of 70px using CSS, and is now in the top left corner.
