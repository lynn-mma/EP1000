<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website, this is where I will be documenting my journey through the Digital Fabrication and Prototyping Fundamentals Module (EP1000). There are 2 main sections to this website.<br><br>The <a href="timeline.html" id="link"> [Timeline]</a> page is where I briefly log what I have achieved and learnt on a weekly basis.<br><br>The projects tabs and its subsequent pages are where I go more in depth into the projects I have done during the module, separated by topic.</p>
<br>
<h1>What is EP1000?</h1>
<p>EP1000 is a module that aims to introduce us students to design thinking concepts, which we will use to design some functional prototypes to meet certain user requirements. Fundamental digital fabrication skills and technologies such as computer-aided design, 2D and 3D modeling, mechanical and electronic design and programming skills are developed through a range of hands-on real world activities. Project management, web and version control techniques, which are important for project development, will also be imparted to us students. We will be using a facility in school called the Fablab, which has the machines, such as laser cutters, 3D printers and cnc machines, for us to learn how to use.</p>
